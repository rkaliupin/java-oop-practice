# java-oop-practice
This repo is used to practice OOP and OOP Patterns.
I perilously may overcomplicate the initial task by adding more complex cases or patterns.

Every project/task would be packed into a separate **release** branch.
On every project completion, a new GitHub release will be created.

I've implemented:
1. State pattern for different ATM states.
2. Chain of Responsibilities pattern for bill withdrawal flow.
3. Try to follow SOLID principles as much as possible.

Primarily I've implemented only withdraw (handled cases with limited amount on a user Card and in limited bills amount in ATM) + States of ATM.
