# java-oop-practice
This repo is used to practice OOP and OOP Patterns.
I perilously may overcomplicate initial task by adding more complex cases or patterns.

Every project/task would be packed into separate **release** branch.
On every project completion new GitHub release will be created.

I didn't find any "fancy patterns" in a simple Lib System on a first look.
Perhaps if to go into each exact problem you may find something.

I decided to design this system in an e-commerce manner.
**(Disclaimer. I didn't design RBAC for access control and just split users into a Reader and Librarian via separate classes due to simplicity. However, for prod build, I would go with RBAC)**
